## **Planning stage**

### **Target Audiences:**

* Potential Employers: My web developer portfolio is primarily aimed at potential employers.
I've designed it to showcase my skills and experience.

* Recruiters: I understand that recruiters often search for web developers through online portfolios. By optimizing my portfolio with relevant keywords and tags, I increase its visibility to recruiters, making it easier for them to discover and consider me as a candidate for various job opportunities.


* Colleagues and Industry Professionals: Sharing my work and knowledge on my portfolio can lead to valuable collaborations, networking opportunities, and knowledge exchange within the web development community.


* Personal and Professional Network: My portfolio is a way to keep my personal and professional network informed about my career progress and share my passion and accomplishments in web development. It's accessible to friends, family, and colleagues who might be interested in my work.

***
### **User Stories:**

* As a visitor, I want to easily understand who the developer is, so I can quickly learn about their background and expertise.

* As a potential employer, I want to see a list of skills, so I can evaluate the developer's proficiency in relevant technologies.

* As a visitor, I want to explore a portfolio section with project details and links to GitHub repositories, so I can assess the developer's practical skills and project diversity. 
***

### **Site Aims:**

* Leverage the portfolio to build a strong online presence, including a presence on professional social media platforms, to expand the developer's reach and influence.

* Display a comprehensive and updated overview of technical skills, coding languages, and frameworks to showcase proficiency in software development.

* Prioritize a positive user experience by optimizing for mobile responsiveness, fast loading times, and easy navigation.

## Automated Testing
